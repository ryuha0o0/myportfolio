summary: A portfolio website created before the current portfolio
abstract: 'This portfolio was developed as a prototype and practice concept before creating the current portfolio. It was hosted on GitHub Pages using Hugo, where I experimented with various web technologies and design principles. This site allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development and experiment with user-centered design. Additionally, by solving issues that arose while implementing various features, I was able to enhance my skills as a developer.'

This portfolio was developed as a prototype and practice concept before creating the current portfolio. It was hosted on GitHub Pages using Hugo, where I experimented with various web technologies and design principles.

The site allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development and experiment with user-centered design. Additionally, by solving issues that arose while implementing various features, I was able to enhance my skills as a developer.
