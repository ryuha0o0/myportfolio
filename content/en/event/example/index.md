This project involved many challenges while creating a bulletin board website to learn the basics of web development. The most difficult aspects were implementing pagination for the bulletin board, setting up the user login service, and connecting to the database.

Pagination was essential to prevent a poor user experience when the number of posts increased, but I felt overwhelmed when trying to implement it for the first time. The login service was also a crucial part for user authentication, requiring significant time to handle session management and security issues. Connecting to the database also presented challenges in writing and debugging various queries.

These difficulties enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web development. This project has taught me a lot and will greatly help my growth as a developer in the future.
