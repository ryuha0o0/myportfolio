My name is Ryu Hayoung. I am currently a junior student in the Department of IT Intelligent Information Engineering at Jeonbuk National University. I have focused on web service development so far, and recently I have started studying information security again. If you would like to see my diary on information security studies, please visit my Velog! I am mainly studying web security.

My hobbies include playing horror games and growing plants. I was born on November 14, 2003, and I am currently 22 years old. Thank you for your attention!
